backup-tools
============

My scripts and setup instructions for backing up my systems.  The idea
is that I run these scripts on the applicable system via cron.  All
backups ultimately push to my workstation with a tape drive.  I then
perform a tape backup there from time to time.  These scripts are very
specific to my systems.

If there is something useful here for your own purposes, feel free to
use it.  If you have suggestions or other ideas for these scripts,
feel free to pass them along to me.
